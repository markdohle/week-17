<h2 id="single-page-applications">Single page applications</h2>
<p>
  In a single-page application, not every request for data has to come all the way from a server; instead, 
  information is cached on the browser for quick access. 
</p>
<p>
  Some examples of single-page applications are: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Netflix</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Gmail</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In a SPA, all of the data retrieved from the server is cached onto the browser, so the need to go to a server 
  every time you want a new piece of data is eliminated. 
</p>
<p>
  There are many benefits to SPAs, including the following: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>They quickly display visual aspects, such as images</li>
<li>They can operate offline because of how they cache data</li>
<li>They have great overall performance; almost as good as a desktop application</li>
</ul>
<p>
  However, there are some drawbacks, including the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>SEO (search engine optimization) is poor</li>
<li>Security issues are more prevalent</li>
<li>The user must have JavaScript enabled for the app to run</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>
<p>
  On a single-page application, routing refers to the use of software that is built to change between different views of 
  an application, without needing to refresh between links. 
</p>
<h2 id="same-page-linking">Same page linking</h2>
<p>
  Same page linking encapsulates any type of linking on a single web page that does not need to go to a server to 
  request new content. 
</p>
<h2 id="web-vs-react-components">Web vs. React components</h2>
<p>
  Although they may sound similar, Web components and React components are not the same.  
  While Web components encapsulate reusable components, React provides a declarative library that keeps the 
  DOM in sync with your data. Web components are built with the browser’s JavaScript API, while React components are 
  generated using the React library.
