Working With React Components

In Module 17: Working With React Components, you’ll focus on web components and routing. In your first exercise, you’ll create simple Bootstrap web components, custom web components, and then convert them to React components. In the second exercise, you’ll learn how to create a single-page application (SPA) and learn when to use a SPA versus a multi-page application. Finally, you’ll bring it all together by completing an exercise where you’ll create the routing on a page with a Bootstrap navigation bar.

2. Convert web components into React components
3. Explain why you would use single-page or multi-page applications
4. Define routing
5. Explain linking in a single-page application
6. Identify the benefits of a single-page application
